# racquet_scorer

Score keeper on your arm for tennis/padel or any other sport where you count in multiples of 15, except for the third one where we minus 5, unless we both reach 3 then we call it 2, but in the old french way, and if someone has nothing then we say 'love' to be extra condescending to the loser with no points.
